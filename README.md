# Portfolio
With the basic idea of HTML, JavaScript and CSS, tried to make a portfolio website with few minimalistic projects from scratch. At the time of developing, didnt paid much attention on responsiveness, Hence its working perfectly with respect to the screen size on which it was developed but have issues on other screensize. Will definitely update and make it working for all dimensions in future.
